## About Me

*Welcome!* I am Felice Antonio Merra a PhD Student working on Security and Adversarial Machine Learning on Recommender Systems. 

I am earning my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Polytechnic University of Bari [@PolibaOfficial](https://twitter.com/PolibaOfficial) working with Prof. Tommaso Di Noia. 

**Email**: [felice.merra@poliba.it](mailto:felice.merra@poliba.it)

## Important News

* **[Highlight]** Long paper accepted at SIGIR2020.
* Stay tune for the arXiv version of the Survey on **Adversarial Learning in Recommender Systems** 

## Research Interest

* Security and Robustness of Recommender Systems (shilling and adversarial learning attacks)
* Adversarial Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems
