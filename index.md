## About Me

*Welcome!* I am Felice Antonio Merra a PhD Student working on Security and Adversarial Machine Learning on Recommender Systems. 

I am earning my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Polytechnic University of Bari [@PolibaOfficial](https://twitter.com/PolibaOfficial) working with Prof. Tommaso Di Noia. 

I will join Amazon.com for a Summer Internship as Machine Learning Research Scientist (July->September 2020).

## Important News

* **[Highlight]** We have released our survey on Adversarial Machine Learning in Recommender Systems! [Click here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10322).
* **[Highlight]** Long paper accepted at SIGIR2020. Pre-print in few days.

## Research Interest

* Security and Robustness of Recommender Systems (shilling and adversarial learning attacks)
* Adversarial Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems
